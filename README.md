# Gulp Workshop

Let's start something!

## A small agenda (for me)

0. A few questions
1. Who am I and what I do every day
2. Overview over build tools in general
3. What does webpack, browserify, etc.
4. Let's begin a project (`npm init`)
5. Install the necessary module
    ```
    npm install --save-dev gulp
    ```
6. Install gulp globally (`npm install -g gulp`)
7. Setup a project:
    ```
    mkdir -p src/assets
    touch src/assets/index.html    # and put some html into it...
    touch gulpfile.js
    ```
